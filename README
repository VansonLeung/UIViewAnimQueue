UIViewAnimQueue

I used example code from a tutorial of making cool buttons in http://www.raywenderlich.com/

And implemented my UIViewAnimQueue inside the CoolButton class.

UIViewAnimQueue is a subclass of UIView.

To use this class, you can add this class as a composition of a certain UIView/UIControl.

Then you can use the function inside the subclass listed in UIViewAnimQueue.h


Public Functions:

Firstly you need to init UIViewAnimQueue, and then you need to point it to a target UIView you wish to control, 
by using the function below:
-(void)setupAnimSessionWithTarget:(UIView*)_target;


The following 2 functions push animation parameters.
Upon pushing, animation should sequentially run one by one.
Custom Rect size:
-(void)pushWithRect:(CGRect)rect delay:(CGFloat)delay duration:(CGFloat)duration curve:(UIViewAnimationCurve)curve;
Return to its original size:
-(void)pushWithDefaultWithDelay:(CGFloat)delay duration:(CGFloat)duration curve:(UIViewAnimationCurve)curve;


Public functions somehow obsolote/buggy below:
-(void)startAnim;


Pause the animation by running the function below:
-(void)stopAnim;


Useful functions below:


You can forcibly pop & run the next animation while overriding currently running animation.
-(void)forcePop;


You can terminate the animation by cleaning the queue.
-(void)cleanQueue;


You can clean the queue while resetting UIView's position at the same time by running the following:
-(void)resetDefault;



Example usage:
Please see "VanButton.h" & "VanButton.m"
