UIViewAnimQueue

I used example code from a tutorial of making cool buttons in http://www.raywenderlich.com/

And implemented my UIViewAnimQueue inside the CoolButton class.

UIViewAnimQueue is a subclass of UIView.

To use this class, you can add this class as a composition of a certain UIView/UIControl.

Then you can use the function inside the subclass listed in UIViewAnimQueue.h

Details will be explained when I have time to go on with this README.
